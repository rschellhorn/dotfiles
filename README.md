# .dotfiles

This repository contains my Bash, ZSH, and Vim settings.

Some of the features include:

* Nicely colored prompt for both Bash and ZSH.
* Automatic project aliases
* Lots of cool aliases
* Ruby on Rails specific aliases
* RVM and rbenv support
* Vim configuration
* ... and much more!

There is absolutely NO guarantee for this project to work on your machine.
Only use this if you know what you are doing.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Command Line tools: xcode-select --install
* [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/)

### Homebrew

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew cask install caffeine firefox google-chrome iterm2
brew install ack chromedriver diff-so-fancy ngrep phantomjs rbenv ruby-build ssh-copy-id vim wget yarn zsh
```

### dotfiles

To install the dotfiles:

    git clone https://github.com/iain/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    ./script/install

This will create backups for anything you already have and add symlinks to
these parts.

### Git

Add and change these lines to `~/.dotfiles/config/personal.sh`:

``` bash
export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Your Name"
export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="yourname@yourdomain.com"

export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME=$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME
export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL
```

See the chapter on personal configuration below for more information.

## Customizing

### iTerm2

In the iTerm2 General settings, check `Load preferences from a user-defined
folder or URL`. Fill in the text field to point to
`/Users/your_name/.dotfiles/iterm2`. You might need to restart iTerm2 after
that.

### Vim

Vim will automatically install itself when you start Vim for the first time.

Delete (or move) your `~/.vim` directory to let it install.

### Personal Configuration

You can put configuration options that are personal, like custom paths, and
other environment variables in one of these files:

* `config/personal.sh` (will be loaded in both Bash and ZSH)
* `config/personal.zsh` (ZSH specific configuration)
* `config/personal.bash` (Bash specific configuration)

### Project aliases

This scripts adds aliases for your project directories, but you'll have to tell
it where your projects can be found. There are however differences in ZSH and
Bash syntax. Use the personal configuration files as mentioned above to set
them.

For ZSH:

    PROJECT_PARENT_DIRS+=("$HOME/Work")
    PROJECT_PARENT_DIRS+=("$HOME/Personal")

For Bash:

    PROJECT_PARENT_DIRS[0]="$HOME/Work"
    PROJECT_PARENT_DIRS[0]="$HOME/Personal"

Add as many directories as you like.

### Fonts

I'm using DejaVuSansMono as font. You can download it [here](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Download).

Programmers can be very anal about fonts, so if you don't like it, feel free to use something
different.

My DejaVuSansMono, including the [powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline)
patch is included for convenience.

## Credits
